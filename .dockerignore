# .dockerignore — files excluded from the Docker build context
#
# Why does this matter?
#   The Docker build context is everything in the project folder that gets
#   sent to the Docker daemon. Large or irrelevant files slow down the build
#   and can inflate the image size. Exclude anything that isn't needed to
#   run the app.

# Python cache files — regenerated at runtime, never needed in the image
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.pyo
.pytest_cache/

# Virtual environments — the image has its own isolated Python environment
.venv/
venv/
env/

# Editor and OS files
.DS_Store
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp

# Git history — not needed to run the app
.git/
.gitignore

# Local development data — uploaded files should come through the browser UI
*.csv
*.xlsx
*.xls

# Documentation and project notes — not needed at runtime
*.md
