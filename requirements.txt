# StatApp dependencies
# Pin minor versions for reproducibility; allow patch updates (e.g. 1.5.x)
#
# Why pin at all?
#   Without pinning, `pip install` always grabs the latest version.
#   A future breaking release could silently break your deployed app.
#   Pinning here + the Docker layer cache means every build is identical.
